#### **Impact on User Onboarding**
- **CRITICAL:** New users won't discover personalized AI features
- **Business Impact:** Reduced user engagement with premium capabilities
- **User Experience:** Confusion about system vs. personal API capabilities
- **Platform Growth:** Limited adoption of user-configured AI services

#### **Recommendations for Nudging System**
1. **Prominent Dashboard Nudges:** Display API key setup prompts on main dashboard
2. **Contextual Hints:** Show setup reminders when accessing AI-powered features  
3. **Onboarding Flow:** Include API key configuration in new user setup
4. **Progressive Disclosure:** Explain benefits of personal vs. system keys
5. **Dismissible Design:** Allow temporary dismissal with periodic re-prompting
